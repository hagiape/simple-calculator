# Create a Simple App Calculator
# 1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
# 2. The application will ask the user for two numbers
# 3. Display the result
# 4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
# 5. If yes, repeat Step 1.
# 6. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 
# 7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.

# try block
# while loop
# ask operation to be used from user
# initialize two variables from input
# first number = input
# second number = input
# perform operation if else
# if +:
# add two variables
# if -:
# subtract two varibles
# if *:
# multiply two variables
# if /:
# divide two variables
# display output
# ask if user wants to try again
# if no break loop
# print 'Thank you'
# if neither yes or no break loop
# raise exception 'please answer only yes or no'
# implement except block
